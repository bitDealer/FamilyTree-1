Use an ArrayList<Person> to store everyone.
Within Person:
	Attributes:

		- Name

		- Birthplace
	<Integer>/<String>
		- Date Married
		- Date Divorced
	<Person>
		- Partner
		- Mother
		- Father
	<ArrayList<Person>>
		- Children
		- Divorcees
	<Boolean>
		- Adopted
		- Alive
		
With this assignment, I chose to base the family tree around an ArrayList structure, holding the custom Person
object within it. I felt this was a good choice to make as otherwise, I was considering a Map approach with
HashMaps. This approach actually takes up more memory per object by around 2x compared to the ArrayList.
I realised when I started that I preferred an ArrayList as I could get the object I wanted whenever I needed it,
as opposed to wanting a key from a Map that I might only know the value for.
The approach that I took with this is limited in the sense that a Directed Graph would have been a more suitable
approach to the project, but I felt like my lack of knowledge in this area would hold me back from completing the
assignment in a suitable manner.
